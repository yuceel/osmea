///
/// Copyright (c) 2025, OSMEA Team
/// https://github.com/masterfabric-mobile/osmea/tree/dev/packages/components
///
/// A foundational container widget that serves as the base for all
/// container-based components in the OSMEA UI Kit.
///
/// {@category Core}
/// {@subCategory Widgets}
///
/// Features:
/// * 🎨 Flexible styling and decoration
/// * 📏 Size constraints and dimensions
/// * 🔄 Transform capabilities
/// * 🎯 Precise alignment control
/// * 🔲 Margin and padding support
/// * ✂️ Custom clipping behavior
///
/// ```dart
/// CoreContainer(
///   width: 200,
///   height: 100,
///   padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
///   color: Colors.blue,
///   child: Text('Hello World'),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Properties:
/// * 📐 [alignment] - Child alignment within container
/// * 🔲 [padding] - Inner spacing around child
/// * 🎨 [color] - Background color
/// * 🖼️ [decoration] - Box decoration (shadows, borders, etc.)
/// * 📏 [width]/[height] - Explicit dimensions
/// * ↔️ [constraints] - Size constraints
/// * 🔄 [transform] - Matrix transformations
///
/// See also:
/// * [Container] - Flutter's container widget
/// * [BoxDecoration] - Container styling
/// * [EdgeInsets] - Padding and margins
