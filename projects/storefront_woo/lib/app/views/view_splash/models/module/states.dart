/*
 * SplashState Definitions
 * -----------------------
 * This file defines the possible states for the Splash screen's ViewModel.
 * Each state represents a distinct UI or navigation condition.
 *
 * - Loading: Indicates splash logic is in progress
 * - Content: Holds data to display on the splash screen
 * - Error: Represents an error state with a message
 * - NavigateHome: Signals navigation to the home screen
